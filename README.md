# Legend
The types used in the description of English syntax and their symbols are:

* `CN` : common nouns ("man", "unicorn")
* `Tm` : terms *i.e.* complete NPs ("the man", "John", "he")
* `IV` : intransitive verbs ("walk", "talk")
* `IAV` : adverbs for intrans. verbs ("slowly", "rapidly")
* `TV` : transitive verbs ("see", "like")
* `T` : sentences (yeah I don't know Montague said it)
